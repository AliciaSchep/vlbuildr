vlbuildr
========

The goal of vlbuildr is to provide an R api for building up vega-lite
specs. This package is in very early stages at the momentâ€¦ API likely to
change!

Inspiration and related work
----------------------------

The API for this package is heavily inspired by the [vegalite R
package](articles/examples.html), but is rebuilt from scratch to (1)
build up the API semi-automatically based on the Vega-lite schema (an
approach inspired by [Altair](https://github.com/altair-viz/altair) and
[vega-lite-api](https://github.com/vega/vega-lite-api)) and (2) take
advantage of the htmlwidget infrastucture for vega specs provided by the
[vegawidget]() package.

Examples
--------

These are some examples showing current capabilities; see [pkgdown
site](https://aliciaschep.github.io/vlbuildr/articles/examples.html) for
more examples.

``` r
library(vlbuildr)
library(vegawidget)
vl_chart() %>%
   vl_add_data(values = mtcars) %>%
   vl_mark_point() %>%
   vl_encode_x(field = "wt", type = "quantitative") %>%
   vl_encode_y(field = "mpg", type = "quantitative") 
```

``` r
vl_chart() %>%
  vl_add_data(url = "https://vega.github.io/vega-editor/app/data/population.json") %>%
  vl_calculate(calculate = "datum.sex == 2 ? 'Female' : 'Male'", 
               as = "gender") %>%
  vl_filter("datum.year == 2000") %>%
  vl_encode_x(field = "age", 
              type = "ordinal") %>%
  vl_scale_x(rangeStep = 17) %>%
  vl_encode_y(field = "people", type = "quantitative") %>%
  vl_stack_y("normalize") %>%
  vl_aggregate_y("sum") %>%
  vl_axis_y(title = "population") %>%
  vl_encode_color(field = "gender", type = "nominal") %>%
  vl_mark_bar() 
```
