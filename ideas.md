# Ideas 

- [ ] For priority args (first ones), pull out the ones that are required!
- [ ] swap vl_add_<>_config for vl_config_<> formatting (but keep old format as deprecated)
- [ ] specialized data functions vl_add_data_url, vl_add_data_values
- [ ] "repeat:column" sugar for encoding
- [ ] if single field (e.g. filter) allow to pass unnamed to .object
- [x] vl$ for make object functions
- [ ] Roxygen consolidation -- use eval
- [ ] Make col --> column 


NEED to make sure ... actually respected for obj functions.
Also add ... capabilities to others

.modify_args shouldn't need to get a list of all acceptable -- can pull fresh? from Schema? And can do its own figuring out of what needs to happen?
