# vlbuildr

The goal of vlbuildr is to provide an R api for building up vega-lite specs. This package is in very early stages at the moment... very incomplete!


## Example

This is an example showing current capabilities:

```{r example}
library(vlbuildr)
vl_chart() %>%
   vl_add_data(values = mtcars) %>%
   vl_mark_point() %>%
   vl_encode_x(field = "wt", type = "quantitative") %>%
   vl_encode_y(field = "mpg", type = "quantitative")
```
